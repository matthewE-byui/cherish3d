Place wedding cake thumbnails in this folder (web-optimized).

- For small/thumbnail images use filenames like: cake-1.jpg, cake-2.jpg
- For full-size originals, add to `fullsize/` with matching names (e.g., `fullsize/cake-1.jpg`).

Keep thumbnails under 200KB and fullsize originals in `fullsize/` for archival.
