    <h2>About Cherish3D</h2>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>What service are we providing?</h3>
      <p>We provide 3D printing of memorable keepsakes by 3D scanning real people, babies, and athletes — creating tangible, high-quality miniature sculptures you can hold.</p>

      <h3>The problem we solve</h3>
      <p>People can't physically hold their past selves or loved ones. Photos capture moments, but we make those moments tangible again — a mother can hold her baby's tiny hand, a bride can hold a keepsake from her wedding day, and sports fans can remember their champion moments.</p>

      <h3>Our exact solution</h3>
      <p>We 3D scan the subject in the moment, create a high-fidelity model, and 3D print and finish a keepsake that represents the real person — not a caricature. The result is a physical, lasting memory you can hold.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>What makes us different</h3>
      <p>Unlike businesses that turn photos into novelty bobbleheads, we 3D scan the real person and reproduce them. Our keepsakes are authentic, detailed, and designed to be cherished — and priced at a fraction of the cost of custom figurine services.</p>
